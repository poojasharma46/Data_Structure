Stack is an user-defined data structure. It is also known as LIFO (Last in First Out) data structure. In stack, an element can be inserted on top, deleted from top.
It is an abstract data type which implies that it gives an implementation-independent view.
Stack is supporting following operations:
Push: Insert at top of the list/array.
Pop: Delete element from the top of the list/array.
Top: Returns the top element from the list/array.
Size: Returns the size of the list/array.
isEmpty: Returns True whether list/array is empty or not.
